Nine in 10 payday loan complaints to the Better Business Bureau are made against online lenders, although online loans account for only about one-third of the market.  Most complaints deal with billing or collections issues, which include unauthorized bank debits, failure to explain or substantiate charges, failure to correct billing errors, and improper collection practices. Other reported problems include fraud, harassment, and dissemination of personal information.
